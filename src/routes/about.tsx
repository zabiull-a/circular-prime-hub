                E-Waste Buyers was founded to professionalise corporate e-waste in India.
                For too long, enterprises have handed retired technology to informal scrap
                channels — losing recoverable value, creating data-security risk and
                generating zero compliance documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                We built the opposite: a B2B-first operation with serial-level asset
                grading, NIST 800-88 data destruction, insured pan-India logistics and
                audit-grade reporting. Today we serve enterprises across IT, BFSI,
                healthcare, manufacturing, telecom and government — from single-site
                refreshes to multi-state data center sunsets.
